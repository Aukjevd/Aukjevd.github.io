            For a school project I coded a webshop. The goal of the project was to learn more about Java Script,
            because of this I didn’t have much time for the CSS. Before this project I hadn’t done much with
            Java Script. So most of the things we had to do where completely new for me.

            <h3>Starting the project</h3>
            <p>
                For this project we worked for the most part by our self. We got a bit of explanation at
                the beginning of each lesson.
                <br>
                We got a few elements that had to be in the project. For example,
                if you add 10 times an item to your card you couldn’t add that item anymore and
                it would say that the item is out of stock. It was a bit difficult to start with the project.
                There where just so many things that had to be added to the project. I didn’t knew where to start.

            <h3>What I learned</h3>
            <p>
                My skills have improved a lot with this project. I now know way more about Java Script.
                We used allot more new techniques. We needed to add some basic features like a buy button.
                And we also needed to add some more complicated features like modals and tooltips.
                Some of the things we needed to add to our webshop where explained by the teacher,
                but allot of things we had to learn on our own.
