                My grandma asked me for help. She is lid at a club that helps elder people stay fit and active.
                That club is called Blijf-Fit. They do swimming and gymnastics under the guidance of a physiotherapist.
                This organization wanted to get more people to join.
                So my grandma asked me to design a flayer to promote it.

                    They didnâ€™t give me much restrictions. I could design it however I wanted to.
                    It just had to have the logo of the club and the right information.
                    I started by looking at different flayers of companies for sport centers like basic fit.

            <div id="blijffit2">
                <p>
                    When I was done with getting inspiration I started the designing process.
                    I started with picking a background color. I chose a vibrant blue,
                    because it stands out and the blue can be associated with swimming.
                    I played a lot around with the composition of the words
                    and I send a few versions of flayer to the head of Blijf-Fit.
                    After a few adjustments we came out with a final design.

            <div id="blijffit3">
                <p>
                    The design was printed out and displayed at different places in the area.
                    After a few weeks it also appeared in the newspaper.
