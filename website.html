            <p>
                For school I had to change an already made website.
                First of I didnâ€™t really see the point of it,
                but then my teacher explained that it can be handy,
                because there are a lot of companies that want you to
                change an already existing website of theirs.

            <h3>Starting the project</h3>
            <p>
                The first thing I needed to do was to come up with a subject for the website.
                Fastly I came up with a subject. I chose Oeteldonk. I chose this, because it just had been Carnaval.
                I wasted no time and started immediately with the project. I had allot of motivation and fun,
                because of that I was the first person to finish the project. Most of the people could barely
                finish 3 pages, but I finished 5 extensive pages and a linked page with ease.

            <h3>What I learned</h3>
            <p>
                With this project I learned allot about how to design a website and how to use the already
                existing things to your advantage. We used the tool MAMP to host the website and we used
                WordPress to get a website and change it. I experimented allot with interactive buttons.
                For example, I made 5 images where if you click on them you go to a whole different website.
                There are also allot of moving things.
