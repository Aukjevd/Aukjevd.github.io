            <h3>Rewriting a website</h3>
            <p>
                For school I had to change an already made website.
                First of I didn’t really see the point of it,
                but then my teacher explained that it can be handy,
                because there are a lot of companies that want you to
                change an already existing website of theirs.

            <h3>Design a flayer for Blijf-Fit</h3>
            <p>
                My grandma asked me for help. She is lid at a club that helps elder people stay fit and active.
                That club is called Blijf-Fit. They do swimming and gymnastics under the guidance of a physiotherapist.
                This organization wanted to get more people to join.
                So my grandma asked me to design a flayer to promote it.

            <h3>Coding a webshop</h3>
            <p>
                For a school project I coded a webshop. The goal of the project was to learn more about Java Script,
                because of this I didn’t have much time for the CSS. Before this project I hadn’t done much with
                Java Script. So most of the things we had to do where completely new for me.
