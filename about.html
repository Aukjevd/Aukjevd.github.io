            <p id="tekst1">
                Who am I? My name is Aukje van Doremalen. I’m a software development student on SintLucas.
                Currently I’m in my second year. I can use HTML, Java script, C# and a little bit of unity
                and I’m still learning more. Sometimes I do some graphic design in my free time.
                For example,
                I made a poster to help promote an organization that helps elder people stay fit and active.

                I live in Den Bosch and I was born on the 8th of august in 2005.
                In my free time I play korfball and I like to go out with friends.
                I love to be social and hang out with my peers. Recently I started working at Young Ones.
                For the most part I look for jobs at festivals or events.
                If those aren’t available I look for clothing stores and when I have my license I want to work as a delivery driver.
                <br>
                I’m also the fashionista of my friend group. Allot of the time I’m busy with the latest fashion trends
                and because of that my friends often come to me for fashion advise. I love to help them out.
